The website I have made for Alfish Games. (non-profit for now)

Some notes:
1) Website's title page needs to be responsive.
2) Images do not belong to me. Since it is non- profit, I have permission to use them.
3) Menu links don't direct you to anywhere, I will add more pages.
4) Social media buttons are not going anywhere too, because it is not an official website.
